<h1>Schelling Model</h1>

A python project to demonstrate an agent-based model around individuals tendecnies to choose to be around people who are more like them rather than those who are different. Thomas Schelling was focused on racial segregation, but the concept could be applied to other avenues. <br>

<h2>Installation</h2>

cd to the directory that contains the <b>requirements.txt</b>, activate a virtual environment and run the following in your terminal or command prompt.

` pip install -r requirements.txt`

Note: I used Python 3.8 and PyQt for this project

<h2>Usage</h2>

In the src directory go main and adjust the global variables within their constraints that you will find in comments.

I suggest running it with the defaults settings to test. Once the program begins press (or hold) the <b>space</b> key to go through iterations.

Agents will start to form clusters around those who are more like them.

Note: I am working on adding extra variables other than likeness, such as wealth. This will make the model interesting. The different color shades of each agent represent their wealth.
